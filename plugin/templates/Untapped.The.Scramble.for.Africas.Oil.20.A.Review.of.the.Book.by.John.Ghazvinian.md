In his book *Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil 20*, John Ghazvinian explores the history and the future of oil production in Africa, a continent that holds about 10% of the world's proven reserves. He travels to 12 African countries, from Nigeria to Angola, from Sudan to Equatorial Guinea, and interviews oil executives, politicians, activists, and ordinary people who are affected by the oil industry.
 
Ghazvinian reveals how oil has shaped Africa's political and economic landscape, often for the worse. He exposes the corruption, violence, and environmental degradation that plague many oil-rich countries. He also examines the role of foreign powers, such as China, the United States, and France, in influencing and exploiting Africa's oil resources. He argues that oil is not a curse, but a potential blessing for Africa, if it is managed wisely and equitably.
 
*Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil 20* is a compelling and informative book that sheds light on a vital and often overlooked topic. It is a must-read for anyone interested in global affairs, energy security, and human rights.

The book is divided into three parts. The first part, titled "The New Frontier", introduces the history and the current state of oil exploration and production in Africa. Ghazvinian explains how Africa became a hot spot for oil companies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as the demand for oil increased and the supply from other regions declined. He also describes the challenges and opportunities that oil presents for Africa's development and security.
 
The second part, titled "The Curse of Oil", focuses on the negative impacts of oil on Africa's politics, society, and environment. Ghazvinian exposes the corruption, violence, and human rights abuses that are linked to oil in countries such as Nigeria, Angola, Sudan, and Chad. He also shows how oil contributes to environmental degradation, climate change, and health problems in Africa. He argues that oil has not brought prosperity or stability to most African countries, but rather poverty and conflict.
 
The third part, titled "The Future of Oil", explores the potential solutions and alternatives for Africa's oil dilemma. Ghazvinian discusses the role of civil society, transparency, accountability, and democracy in improving oil governance and distribution in Africa. He also examines the role of foreign powers, such as China, the United States, and France, in supporting or undermining Africa's oil interests. He argues that Africa needs to diversify its economy, invest in renewable energy sources, and cooperate with other regions to ensure a fair and sustainable use of oil.
