In this article, we will show you how to calibrate your monitor with Spectracal Calman 5 in a few simple steps. You will need a compatible meter, such as the SpectraCal C6 or the X-Rite i1 Display Pro, and a pattern generator, such as the SpectraCal VideoForge or the Blackmagic Teranex Mini. You will also need a license key for Calman 5, which you can purchase from Spectracal's website or from authorized resellers.
 
## Step 1: Install and Launch Calman 5
 
Download and install Calman 5 from Spectracal's website. You will need to create an account and register your license key before you can use the software. Once you have installed and activated Calman 5, launch it and select your preferred workflow from the main menu. For this example, we will use the "Monitor - sRGB" workflow, which is designed for calibrating computer monitors to the sRGB color space.
 
## Step 2: Connect and Configure Your Meter and Pattern Generator
 
Connect your meter and pattern generator to your computer via USB or HDMI. Make sure they are powered on and recognized by Calman 5. You can check their status in the "Find Meter" and "Find Source" tabs on the left panel. If they are not detected, you may need to install drivers or update firmware for them.
 
Once your meter and pattern generator are connected, you need to configure them in Calman 5. Go to the "Meter Settings" tab and select your meter model from the drop-down menu. You can also adjust the integration time, sync mode, low-light handling, and other options according to your preferences. Next, go to the "Source Settings" tab and select your pattern generator model from the drop-down menu. You can also choose the output resolution, frame rate, color space, bit depth, and other options according to your monitor specifications.
 
## Step 3: Measure Your Monitor's Pre-Calibration Performance
 
Before you start calibrating your monitor, you need to measure its pre-calibration performance and see how far it deviates from the target standards. Go to the "Display Pre-Test" tab and click on "Read Series". Calman 5 will send a series of test patterns to your monitor and measure its luminance, contrast ratio, gamma, color temperature, color gamut, grayscale accuracy, and color accuracy. You can see the results in graphs and charts on the right panel.
 
If your monitor's pre-calibration performance is within acceptable limits, you can skip the calibration process and go to the verification step. However, if your monitor's pre-calibration performance is poor or inconsistent, you need to calibrate it to improve its quality.
 
## Step 4: Calibrate Your Monitor's Brightness, Contrast, Color Temperature, and Gamma
 
The first step of calibration is to adjust your monitor's brightness, contrast, color temperature, and gamma using its OSD (on-screen display) controls. These are basic settings that affect the overall appearance of your monitor. Go to the "Display Optimization" tab and follow the instructions on the screen.
 
You will need to use your meter to measure your monitor's luminance level and contrast ratio. You will also need to use your pattern generator to send different grayscale patterns to your monitor. Calman 5 will guide you through the process of adjusting your monitor's brightness, contrast, color temperature, and gamma until they match the target values.
